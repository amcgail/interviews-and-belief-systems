Research diary – Jakob Arnoldi; June 3-14

Have been reading through the Demos publications that Judith sent me and all Janet’s material. Went to see John Holden at Demos Friday 14. Very forthcoming, I have access from Monday morning but it nevertheless seems clear that he is not overenthusiastic about this taking more than three weeks. Some of the publications I can take home with me, which I of course will do. He gave me a list of the publications published by Demos. Interestingly, amount of sold copies is also included on the list. Don’t know if you have that info already but I will bring it to the next meeting just in case.
Was Friday also attending a seminar on intellectual property. Bob Jessop from Lancaster gave a talk on the global knowledge economy. He gave a brief outline of the genealogy of the term and argued that the idea of the knowledge economy was powerful because it could be absorbed in a range of political strategies on a range of levels and in a range of institutional settings – which precisely was what had happened. He called it a ‘Rochart [d?] ink blot phenomenon’; the contours of the knowledge economy could be seen everywhere. The parallels to Tom’s discussion on ideas as viruses that are ‘contracted’ were obvious. When I asked for references, for a moment thinking that he was referring to empirical studies on the knowledge economy/society idea, he said that he actually was thinking about applying to the ESRC for funds to study how that idea had come to permeate political discourse and policy. I told him about our project in the interval. I also mentioned that we were studying the Third Way idea. He saw that as an idea that fits into this more overall idea of the global knowledge economy. I have trouble seeing how these different ideas can be ordered in such a way where the biggest encompass the others, so we briefly discussed how and if they are connected (which brings us back to the question of discreteness again). 
At the same conference I heard that Geoff Mulgan was giving a talk at the ICA the same evening (Scott Lash was also on the panel, don’t know if there were others and don’t know the topic but will ask Scott). I was not able to attend.
