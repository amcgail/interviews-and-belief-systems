That was the first one. Then he went as a tea taster I think, next, he gave that up. He gave that up and then he went to work at Doultons over the Thames, the China people, yes over there. And then in the end, he thought, well I don't know, he thought he'd try chimney sweeping, so of course Grandpa you see, my great grandfather was left, you see, with his mother, his father left him for a captain on board this ship and went off with somebody else and his mother died with a broken heart, and as they hadn't anything he was left on his own and he was put into the workhouse.
